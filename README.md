Code Snippets for the "What's coming to C# 9.0" session during MVP Israel 2020 conf.

The demo files are \*.linq files. Those are code scripts that can be executed with LinqPad (free version).That being said, they are eventually text files that you can open with notepad and then copy the code to Visual Studio or any other editor to your liking.

Slides are available both as a local copy in the repo and on the following link:
